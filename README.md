Implementation of BlockChain Using Linked List

I have implemented a Private Blockchain using Linked List in C++. A private Blockchain is a one which is governed by a single entity, 
who is responsible for adding new members to the Blockchain. In the case of my Project it is, the Reserve Bank of India.

The Project intends to showcase a model in which :
All the Account holders of various banks in INDIA are added to a common Blockchain, so the RBI can instantly be notified about any kind of transaction,
this makes it easy to calculate the Cash Inflows and Outflows in the Indian Economy, it will also help to decrease fradulent activities as Blockchain offers
immutabilty and all the ransactional data will immediately get uploaded to a database.


The Project consists of functions which can :
  void create_blockchain();
	void display_blockchain();	
	void display_blockchain_head();
	void search_blockchain();
	void insert_block();
	void transact_blockchain();
	void insert_Loan();
	void bank_database();
  
 Whenever a data is altered with, a separate block gets created offering an irrefutable proof which can help us to establish trust as a service.
